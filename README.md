This repository demonstrates a common mistake when adding event listeners in JavaScript within an HTML file.  The issue arises when multiple event listeners are attached to the same element using the assignment operator (=) instead of `addEventListener`. Only the last listener assigned will be active, effectively overriding previous ones.  The solution shows the correct approach using `addEventListener` to attach multiple listeners without overwriting each other.
